            These are my business cards that I designed using Adobe Photoshop and a little bit of InDesign as well. I created the logo and used a picture of orlando as the background.

            These two pictures were a lot of fun to make, in my free time I like to edit photos. The first one is a picture of the fountain at UCF with a couple of filters on them.
            The next is a picture of the orlando skyline with a couple of edits and the Orlando city logo in the background.

      I love sports. So a lot of my work reflects that. The first picture is a flyer I made for the Orlando City soccer team for their home opener this year.
      The other photo is a statsheet for my favorite hockey player Nikita Kucherov. Both were made using Illustrator and Photoshop

            <h3>My Work</h3>
            <p>I get a lot of my inspiration from the things that I enjoy in life. Like a lot of the things i design are sports related, specifically Orlando City, UCF,
               New England Patriots, Tampa Bay Lightning, or Manchester United. If it's not sports related it will probably be either video game related or something random that I came up with and wanted to make.</p>
